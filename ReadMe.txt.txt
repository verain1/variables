Static variable:
	a. It a class level variable.

		-> static constructor
		-> static function
		-> static properties
		-> classname.
	d. Can be initialised/ updated multiple times [important]
	e. Field of use:
		-> Office Address, officePhoneNumber.

	a. It a class level variable
	b. It creates only a single gloacopy.
